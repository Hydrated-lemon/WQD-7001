## Project Background

Diabetes is a metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia due to defects in insulin secretion or action. It is associated with severe complications affecting various organs and poses a significant financial burden. Early diagnosis and prediction using machine learning can help mitigate these issues.

## Problem Statement

The project aims to identify significant diabetes risk factors using statistical analysis and develop machine learning models to predict diabetes risk based on body data from wearable devices.

## Project Objectives

1. Identify significant risk factors for diabetes using statistical techniques.
2. Construct an effective binary classification model to predict diabetes risk.
3. Develop an interpretable and accessible IoT data product for non-technical users.

## Methodology

### Data Interpretation

- **Parametric Tests**: Proportion Test, Z-Test.
- **Non-Parametric Tests**: Chi-Square Test, Mann-Whitney U Test.
- **Effect Size Measures**: Cohen’s d, Cohen’s h, Cramér’s V.

### Machine Learning

- Techniques: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, etc.
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.
- Handling Imbalanced Data: Oversampling techniques.
- Model Fitting and Evaluation: With and without oversampling.


## Deployment

Simple Data Product deployment on Streamlit
